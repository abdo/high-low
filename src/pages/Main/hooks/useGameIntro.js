          It starts with a deck of cards, the first card is drawn from that deck
          and added to a pile. <br />
          You then have to guess whether the next card's number will be a higher
          number or lower number than the latest card. If you are correct, we
          add that card to the pile. If you are incorrect, you get a point for
          every card that was in the pile at that time (for example, if 10 cards
          were in the pile, you would get 10 points).And the pile is cleared.{' '}
          <br />
          After users have 3 successful guesses in a row, they can "pass" to the
          other player. By pass we mean that if you start as Player 1, you can
          change to Player 2. <br /> Player 2 can pass back to Player 1 once
          they get 3 successful guesses in a row. The player with the least
          number of points at the end wins.
